## Logger for Aws Cloud Watch

### Breaking Change for version 1.0

When this package started, it started as a listener for log events and would only work with another channel.
This package would listen to log events and just add extra log to cloud watch. So, you did not need to add cloudwatch as a `channel`.
But after `1.0` it works as a custom driver.
So, you MUST add `LOG_CHANNEL` as `cloudwatch` in your logging config for this to work going forward. 

### Installation

`composer require pagevamp/laravel-cloudwatch-logs`

### Example

You can use laravel's default `\Log` class to use this

`\Log::info('user logged in', ['id' => 123, 'name' => 'Naren']);`

### Usage with AWS Lambda

Make sure the AWS Lambda template contains an IAM role with enough access.
So think about Logs:CreateLogGroup, Logs:DescribeLogGroups, Logs:CreateLogStream, Logs:DescribeLogStream, Logs:PutRetentionPolicy and Logs:PutLogEvents

### Config

Config for logging is defined at `config/logging.php`. Add `cloudwatch` to the `channels` array

```
'channels' =>  [
    'cloudwatch' => [
            'driver' => 'custom',
            'name' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_NAME', ''),
            'region' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_REGION', ''),
            'credentials' => [
                'key' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_KEY', ''),
                'secret' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_SECRET', '')
            ],
            'stream_name' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM_NAME', 'laravel_app'),
            'retention' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS', 14),
            'group_name' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME', 'laravel_app'),
            'version' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_VERSION', 'latest'),
            'formatter' => \Monolog\Formatter\JsonFormatter::class,       
            'batch_size' => env('CLOUDWATCH_LOG_BATCH_SIZE', 10000),
            'create_group' => env('CLOUDWATCH_CREATE_GROUP', true)
            'via' => \Pagevamp\Logger::class,
        ],
]
```

And set the `LOG_CHANNEL` in your environment variable to `cloudwatch`.

If the role of your AWS EC2 instance has access to Cloudwatch logs, `CLOUDWATCH_LOG_KEY` and `CLOUDWATCH_LOG_SECRET` need not be defined in your `.env` file.

### AWS IAM permissions

The needed permissions can be found [here](https://github.com/maxbanton/cwh#aws-iam-needed-permissions).

### Contribution

I have added a `pre-commit` hook to run `php-cs-fixer` whenever you make a commit. To enable this run `sh hooks.sh`.
